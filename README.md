# AI_Search_Algorithm-
The purpose of this assignment is to implement a problem-solving agent using a search algorithm. You will implement three different strategies: breadth first search, depth-first search and A star. Given a problem, your implementation will indicate whether there is a solution from the initial state to the goal state. When a solution exists, you will indicate, for each strategy, all the steps taken, the states that have been visited and the ones that have been considered for examination.
